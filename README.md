# fzy-tools
script wrappers for fzy

A collection of scripts I wrote to pipe stdout through fzy.
Obviously the only real dependancy is fzy, although I Have written the scripts with bash in mind.

If you have patches please send them via github, and I will try to review them as quckly as I can.

Cheers
